As a patient coordina-\ntor at a clinic renowned for its high success rates and cutting-edge research,\nI helped patients from around the world navigate the difficult process of\ninfertility treatment through reproductive technologies. Many of the pa-\ntients I “coordinated” —a task that involved a combination of administrative\nprocessing, appointment scheduling, medical education, and impromptu\ncounseling—had been unsuccessfully treated for infertility prior to their\nappointment at CRMI. During my two years in this position, between 2004\nand 2006, I spoke with hundreds of individuals and couples undergoing\ntreatment for infertility, many of whom had grappled with this diagnosis\nfor came time."

          "text": "During my interactions with patients, they often spoke about how difficult\nit was when their predicted path to parenthood had been derailed.! Women\ndiagnosed with “advanced maternal age” often expressed the feeling that this\nwas their last chance to be parents. They didn’t know they wanted to have\nchildren so much until it was too late or had only now met someone with\nwhom they wanted to have kids.” In and outside of the clinic, questions of\nage permeated discussions of infertility, especially “female-factor infertility.”\nSex-specific structural abnormalities such as polyps and endometriosis also\ncame up, but less frequently. In my discussions with men diagnosed with\n“male-factor infertility,” age was not often brought up. But they too expressed\nanxiety, often over the phone, during calls that took place after our in-person\nmeetings. I answered nervous questions about the semen-collection process\nand repeated the details of semen-analysis procedures so many times that\nThad a script for nearly every nervous query. Other men and women faced\nthe difficult challenge of being diagnosed with “unexplained infertility” and\nlamented the lack of clarity that such an enigmatic label conferred."

Questions about why a specific person is\ninfertile can quickly turn into answers that stress individual responsibility for\nreproductive health. For instance, patients often wondered if they had done\nsomething to cause their infertility or were doing something wrong in their\nefforts to conceive. They looked for suggestions for things they could do,\nor take, or eat, or abstain from to make themselves fertile. Not only do such\npursuits show how determined many people are to meet personal, social,\ncultural, and familial expectations of biological relatedness.* They also show\nhow much people internalize the idea that pregnancy is an accomplishment\n(Becker 2000). This is especially the case for women, since infertility has\nhistorically been conceptualized as a women’s problem, and women’s bodies\ncontinue to take center stage during infertility treatments (Thompson 2005)."

Studies of sperm decline\nemphasized not only individual behaviors, genes, and physical characteristics\nbut also the effects of occupational settings, pollutants, food, and household\nproducts on male developmental and reproductive health.
